# Urban Art Project

## Technologies


## Objective
Understand and develop simple layouts with Bootstrap.

<br />

## What Have I learned?
This project is teaching me many things, <br />like for instance: <br /><i>How to think as Bootstrap Developer? How to create Layouts and adapt with my final idea?</i>

See the using of the classes of Bootstrap to speed the development: <i> container-fluid, container, row, justify-content-center and more.</i>

## Considerations
Really this Framework will help a lot! It becomes to create several layouts simpler and faster way.
